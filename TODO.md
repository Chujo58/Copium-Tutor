I've created this file since I'm currently offline (in da plane 🛫) so I can't access the GitHub issue for this PR.

In order, here are the other things I wish to fix with this PR.
1. Fix the large number of redraws of the Sidebar (I guess because it's imported in many files, it gets redrawn?). Maybe store the current project in a cookie sort of thing, similar to how the authentication worked until this point.
2. After rebasing this PR (at some point when I get back online), make it so that the right click on a course page in the sidebar also has an edit subpage.
3. Again after rebase, maybe fix the right click menu to include, open in new page, reload, etc... (not sure what I added in there in the first place so)...
4. If I've got time, fix the CardsInHand SVG, to remove the fill color being necessary. That probably means redrawing the entire thing but welp.
