Login Page -> Link the user to the chats they made
- Only if we have time to do this
My Subject Page -> Sorta like projects in GPT, so you give the AI some documents and it should have its own dashboard, quizzes, chats, cards, etc.
- Une section pour donner des documents à l'IA, basically an access to the knowledge base
- Une section du genre flashcards -> kinda stupid to make a chat to get flashcards
- Ready to go quizzes, even stuff for midterms and exams
- A section for chats so that we can talk about smaller subjects.
- Like a tagging system for chats, idk, or a option to choose the coding language

AI Modes:
Study mode -> question prompt, explanation output + examples etc
Quiz mode -> Back and forth question

Pass the knowledge base through a hard reasoning model and source everything into the memory
Or we index the documents in the database
Try to make it stick to the data we give it -> or maybe we can engineer and pick that value


EX: one class we all took
250,206,551

Dashboard like page that has folders that have the subjects we wanna do, clicking on them opens a new sort of dashboard

Drag and drop at the top to upload shit -> click to open the doc, close button on it to remove it.
Two sections, une pour les flashcards, une pour le study/quiz/review mode (a voir)
Then last section for chats.

Node.js with python backend and json db maybe
